In the same way that the “corporate directory” feature of VoIP hardphones enables users to easily dial by name via their VoIP handsets, ACE was developed as a research idea born from “VoIP Hopper” to automate VoIP attacks that can be targeted against names in an enterprise Directory. The concept is that in the future, attacks will be carried out against users based on their name, rather than targeting VoIP traffic against random RTP audio streams or IP addresses. ACE works by using DHCP, TFTP, and HTTP in order to download the VoIP corporate directory. It then outputs the directory to a text file, which can be used as input to other VoIP assessment tools."

The implementation is very dirty, supports only several data types, and in any case cannot be stated ‘standard-conforming’! It was designed to be fast, and it is fast. For this reason (well, and also because of my laziness ;), there is no ASN.1 parser in braa – you HAVE to know the numerical values of OID’s (for instance .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 instead of system.sysName.0)."

If the gateway hostdoes not allow the traffic, it will likely drop the packets on the floor and we will see no response. To get the correct IP TTL that will result in expired packets one beyond the gateway we need to ramp up hop-counts. We do this in the same manner that traceroute works. Once we have the gateway hopcount (at that point the scan is said to be `bound`) we can begin our scan.

With access the original source, you can run a simple Java program and attach a debugger to it remotely, stepping through code and changing variables where needed. Doing the same with an applet is a little bit more difficult. Unfortunately, real-life scenarios don’t offer you this option, anyway. Compilation and decompilation of Java are not really as deterministic as you might imagine. Therefore, you can’t just decompile a Java application, run it locally and attach a debugger to it. Next, you may try to just alter the communication channel between the client and the server, which is where most of the interesting things happen anyway. This works if the client uses HTTP with a configurable proxy. Otherwise, you’re stuck with generic network traffic altering mechanisms.
